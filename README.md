I have deployed this smart contract on Goerli testnet . 

so for Goerli Testnet : 
VRF Coordinator	: 0x2Ca8E0C643bDe4C2E08ab1fA0da3401AdAD7734D
Key Hash/GasLane : 	0x79d3d8832d904592c0bf9818b621522c988bb8b0c05cdc3b15aea1b6e8db0c15
Subscription ID : 8497    It is a type of subscription for using chainlink vrfs . 
CallbackGasLimit : 500000 










# Decentralized_Lottery
A Decentralized Lottery Smart Contract 

For Smart Contract : Using Solidity 
Development Enviroment : Hardhat 
For Randomness Generation : Using Chainlink VRFs
For Automating The Smart Contract : Using Chainlink Keeper 

# Functionlities 

Players can enter the lottery by paying a certain amount
Generate a random winner. (optional for you to give the hint: can do using chain link
VRF).

Transfer all the amount deposited to the winner
Make it automated generating winners and distributing funds after a fixed time
